# Javascript Notes
This is a deeper look into web development for me, it is also a foundation for my projects using JS

These notes are condensed from many youtube and coursera tutorials - like the data mining notes. 
I take notes like this so that I can look back and find a concept quickly without having to go back to the source materials.

Feel free to look around and point out any errors! I'm open to suggestions to improve them.
